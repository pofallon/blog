## Hello, MDX!

This is the demo entry for the MDX content pipeline. If you're seeing this page rendered at `/posts/demo-mdx`, the pipeline is working correctly.

### Features Demonstrated

- ✓ Frontmatter parsing
- ✓ Markdown rendering
- ✓ Build-time validation

### Code Example

Here's a TypeScript snippet showing the frontmatter schema:

```typescript
type FrontmatterMetadata = {
  title: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  description: string;
  image?: ImageMeta;
};
```

## How It Works

1. **Content Discovery**: MDX files are scanned from `/content/posts/`
2. **Frontmatter Validation**: Each file's metadata is validated against a Zod schema
3. **Slug Generation**: The filename becomes the URL slug (e.g., `demo-mdx.mdx` → `/posts/demo-mdx`)
4. **Static Generation**: Pages are pre-rendered at build time for optimal performance

## Next Steps

Add your own MDX files to `/content/posts/` and they'll automatically appear as new routes.
